      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p><em>Last Updated: 2025-06-04</em></p>

      <p>By using our website (bullseye2d.org) or any software, products, or services we offer, you're agreeing to these simple terms.</p>

      <h2>Using Our Services</h2>
      <p>You can use Bullseye2D's core library under the MIT License, which gives you a lot of freedom. You can find the full MIT License text with the software.</p>
      <p>If you purchase a "Premium Edition" license or a "Sponsorship" tier, you get access to additional features or benefits as described on our website at the time of purchase.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Premium Edition/Supporter Licenses</strong> are typically one-time purchases. They grant you a perpetual license to use the version of the premium features available at the time of purchase and for the update period specified (e.g., 1 year of updates). After the update period, you can continue to use the software you have, but you won't receive new premium updates unless you renew or purchase a new license. Seat limits (number of developers) per license apply as stated during purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Sponsorship Tiers</strong> are usually monthly subscriptions and provide ongoing access to Premium Edition benefits and any other listed sponsorship perks as long as your subscription is active.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Please use our Services responsibly and legally. Don't try to misuse or interfere with them.</p>

      <h2>Payments and Refunds</h2>
      <p>Payments for our Services are processed through our payment partner, Stripe. By making a purchase, you agree to their terms as well.</p>
      <p>For digital products and subscriptions like the Premium Edition or Sponsorships:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>One-time purchases (Premium Edition):</strong> Generally, all sales are final. If you have a significant issue, please <span class="email-placeholder">contact us</span> within 7 days of purchase, and we'll see if we can help.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions (Sponsorships):</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time. Your access will continue until the end of your current paid billing period. We generally don't offer refunds for partial subscription periods.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Your Content and Creations</h2>
      <p>Games and content you create using Bullseye2D are yours. We don't claim any ownership over your creations.</p>

      <h2>Our Rights</h2>
      <p>We might need to change these terms or our Services from time to time. If we make a big change to the terms, we'll try to let you know (for example, by posting on our website). Continuing to use the Services after changes means you accept the new terms.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our Services if you violate these terms or misuse the Services, without a refund.</p>

      <h2>No Warranties & Limitation of Liability (The Legal Bit)</h2>
      <p>We provide our Services "as is." We do our best to make them great, but we can't guarantee they'll always be perfect or uninterrupted. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Bullseye2D (and Asylum Square Interactive GmbH) isn't liable for any damages or losses related to your use of our Services.</p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about these terms, please <span class="email-placeholder">contact us</span>.</p>
